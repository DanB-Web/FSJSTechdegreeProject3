Interactive Form

Project Objectives - Standard

1) Downloaded and linked necessary files, including jQuery and normalize.css

2) On page load, focus goes to Name: by default

3) Added hidden div that will reveal if the user selects 'Other' from 'Job Role' dropdown. Added required id and placeholder

4) As per exceeds requirements, the t-shirt 'Color' dropdown is hidden until a 'Theme' is selected. The available 'Color' options is then dependent on the 'Theme' selected

5) The 'Activities' section will display a running total cost, dependent on the activities chosen. Conflicting activities are disabled and greyed out

6) Only one payment method is displayed at a time. By default, this will be 'Credit Card'

7) Form validation added - Name cannot be blank, e-mail address must be valid, at least one activity chosen, valid credit card details (if selected)

8) Form validation messages added - the targeted field will display a red border, and an error div showing more information will be displayed

9) Confirmed form still works without JS - no new HTML added from original project files



Project Objectives - Extra Credit

1) The 'Color' dropdown menu is hidden until a 'Theme' is selected

2) Conditional Error Message added to credit card number field - will display different messages for i) No input ii) Incorrect number of digits

3) Real Time Error Message added to email field - will compare input with regex on every keystroke and display error (if applicable)


Comments

A few objectives seemed to be overlapping a bit - In such cases, I've added comments in the code and commented out certain lines, so the program could be refactored at a later date if necessary
